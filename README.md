# Silent PowerShell Execution

This C++ code demonstrates how to execute a PowerShell command silently in the background without opening a visible window. The code uses the Windows API functions to invoke PowerShell and run the specified command.

## Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- Visual Studio (version 2012 or later)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Put your own powershell command
4. Build the project to generate the executable.
5. Execute the generated executable to run the PowerShell command silently.

## Code Explanation

The code follows these steps to run the PowerShell command silently:

1. Encode the PowerShell command using base64 encoding.
2. Construct the command line with the encoded command.
3. Use the `ShellExecute` function from the Windows API with the `SW_HIDE` flag to execute the command without opening a visible window.

## Customization

To customize the PowerShell command to be executed, modify the `encodedCommand` variable in the source code. Replace the example encoded command with your own encoded command.
